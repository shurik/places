People and Places [#]_
======================

People have so many friends nowadays they have started to use a common, on-line, web database called Facebook to keep them organized. The database allows the people to create, store and edit pieces of text about themselves and others, organize that text into conversations, locate themselves on maps, upload pictures of themselves.

The different bits of information about or written by a person are organized around an idea of a wall posting. Artists have long used physical walls as a place to display their work. But unlike the different pieces of information displayed on a Facebook wall visual artists have tended to combine the different pieces of text and images into a coherent single image based on some unique principles.

This is a `buildout <http://www.buildout.org/>`_ for a `Django <http://djangoproject.com/>`_ web site and an art project that generates a visual representation of one's Facebook presence.

The site's visitor is given the opportunity to login to their Facebook account and grant the web site the permission to read their Facebook profile and profiles of their friends. The site will then use the text and images to create a visual collage and display it back to the visitor and allow them to download an image of the collage to their personal computer and post about the site on Facebook.

.. [#] This is a working title that references a possible emphasis for organizing the image, as a map of one's friends.
