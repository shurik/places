Places & Friends
================

This is a buildout for an art project that maps one's Facebook friendships by generating a map of hometowns of one's friends.

The initial version of project will render a map of the world marked with the locations of hometowns of a visitors' friends retrieved from Facebook. This version is titled 'Origins'.
